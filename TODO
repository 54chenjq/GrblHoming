This file contains enhancements the developer and user community would like to see:

Primary:
- Restore "Tool change" feature, including popup dialog
- Implement support for Grbl 0.8c "homing" feature
- Save/Load current GRBL settings from disk
- Suppress some bookkeeping output from the status window
- Add local Help linked from main screen and options dialog
- When parsing for visualizer, if bad value arg, warn user
- If nothing appears in visualizer, attempt to diagnose and explain to user
- Every second or so, if not scrolled to bottom, scroll to bottom of status
- If get error from grbl, provide command that generated error on same line
- Allow user to choose how to handle unspecified units in file for visualizer
- Popup to let user know they can run jobs faster if using aggressive preload
- Auto-scale widgets to full screen size
- Allow reload of same file from same location
- Fix Width/Depth legend to use Width-X Depth-Y Height-Z
- Can't see drill holes under axis, move axes under toolpaths?
- Fix Zero position next to begin?
- Collect all detected errors and display them at the end after a file run
- Don't filter Program Pause/End in 0.8 (i.e. M30) - meaning, look at Grbl
  wiki https://github.com/grbl/grbl/wiki and compare supported codes to filtered
- UI support for homing limit switches
- Show drill holes as larger dots?
- Display current feedrate in mm/sec or in/sec
- Don't fail on timeout waiting for command - let user continue if they want
- Add additional rs232 error logging value (-1 is not very useful)
- Pick up from where left off (if GC dies due to PC falling asleep, etc.)
- Turn log on by default
- Report system settings at beginning of log file. Include OS.
- Recommend to user to use aggressive preload if not using it
- Analyze file ahead of time and determine if it will go beyond extents
- Build in calibration pattern
- Build in "flatten table feature"
- Filtered commands sent option vs raw as-is checkbox
- File viewer

Secondary:
- Look at all hardware connection options of Grbl on the shield and make
  sure that we have some way to control those, i.e. spindle control.
- Recent files list under 'Files'
- Clear log button
- Restore "Favorites" feature
- Print current GRBL settings
- Add option to auto connect to last port
- Provide diagnostic response view
- Provide counter showing time waiting for a response if time > 5s
- Estimated time to completion (this can acutally be computed from feedrates)
