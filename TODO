This file contains enhancements the developer would like to implement:

- Ensure that output window shows all text
- Fix default go to home on completion issue (right now that is commented out to prevent destroying work/bit)
- Strange bug when using Z jog after completing file run - the command spins up the z motor speed quite a lot
- Consolidate duplicated waitForPrompt code
- Provide means to handle max timeout (i.e. timed out waiting popup - ok to quit or continue waiting?)
- Setting for default wait timeout
- Handle "error" response and display error message
- Handle 0.5 168 processor bug: binary response garbage causes failure (ignore and resend?)
- Store last good port used and display at startup so you don't have to pick it
- Show only available com ports
- Add option to auto connect to last port
- Verify that entering x/y/z move commands are absolute and not relative
- Find way to remote reset grbl controller with button added so don't have to physically reset arduino
- Fix enabling Begin button when already started
- Provide diagnostic response view
- Provide counter showing time waiting for a response if time > 5s
- Remove radio buttons - allow user to do any of the three operations without special mode state requirement
- Popup dialog when successful send is complete
- Print current GRBL settings
- Compile for Mac
