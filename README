                        ---- GrblController ----

GrblController is a gcode sender, monitor and homing tool for GRBL for 
Mac, Windows and Linux systems written using the Qt Desktop Framework in C++.

Enhanced by Zapmaker. Kosme did a great deal of excellent foundation work on this 
project.

Version 3.0 is a near-complete rewrite of the C++ code fixing all known bugs.
The other major enhancement is native Mac OSX support (including older 32 bit Intel 10.5).

The code was tested with real milling projects using the Shapeoko and works
pretty well. For a list of possible future enhancements, see file TODO.

Prebuilt binaries/installers can be found on github's download section for this
project (GrblHoming). Alternately, if you download the (a) Qt SDK from Nokia or 
(b) the Qt source from Qt Project along with the standalone Qt Creator, you can
build from source.

Details on how to do this can be found here:

V3.0
Enhancements
- Nearly a full code rewrite to ensure ease-of-use and robustness
- Percentage complete progress bar for files; also shows time elapsed sending file.
- Reset button now cycles COM port which causes Arduino to stop steppers and
  reinitialize position to 0,0,0 (No more manual Auduino resets!)
- Settings configurations are now stored using QSettings class for platform independence.
- Only available COM ports are now shown. Uses third-party QextSerialPort library.
- App remembers last COM port used, last folder, last file extension used after restart
- Ability to configure wait-for-response time
- Status list window now shows both sent and received data
- Error responses are ignored during file send (nearly 100% of the time they are not important)
- Z-jog speed using buttons is configurable
- Radio buttons to select mode have been removed in favor of enabling/disabling widgets based
  on current context. This simplifies usage.
- Popups have been removed in favor of writing errors to status list window

Bug fixes
- Overall code hardening
- Properly implementing Qt signals and slots across the board

Build verification
- Windows 7 64 bit using MinGW
- Inno Setup for Windows, installs successfully on Windows 7
- Mac OSX Mountain Lion, target 64 bit and 32 bit executables
- Qt Mac installer successfully installs and runs on Mountain Lion and 10.5 32 bit Intel
- Linux: Builds successfully on Debian 6, Ubuntu 12.10

V2.1x1

NOTE: Changes were only focused on Arduino GRBL capabilities with the Shapeoko, so 
things like Tool Change were not tested.

Enhancements
- Improved handling of response code - this is the most significant change as it 
ensures reliable send/response handling when sending a file to the Grbl processor.
- Manual command now allows hitting return and command is sent. No need to press Go.
- Default job step size changed from 0.01 to 1 mm
- Compiles and runs under Linux now (tested with Debian and latest Qt)
- Works with old 168 Arduino processor (except that old code is buggy and not recommended)
- Disabled "go to home at end of job". The arduino code doesn't handle it correctly 
and mills straight back into and through your work. Checkbox in settings has no effect.

Bug fixes
- Fixed crash when options file is not present the first time run
- Fixed crash when trying to get GRBL settings from device
- Settings work with 168 (8 settings) and 328 processors (10 settings)
- Fixed Stop to call proper routine stopsig - now Stop button works correctly

Fork by Zapmaker at this rev
-------------------------------------------------------------
v2.1a

Bug fixes

- Corrected an issue that caused the program to crash if the g-code had blank lines.

V2.1 

New Features

- Gcode that is valid but is not recognized by GRBL gets filtered and it is not sent.

Bug fixes

- Corrected an issue that prevented manually sent Gcode for being displayed correctly.
- Corrected an issue with the images not displaying.

V2.0 Major release

- Improved the port handling reducing opening and closing frecuency.
- Added the ability to type and send commands directly. 
- Support for tool change instructions. If enabled it pauses execution, raises the spindle, goes to a fixed location for toolchange, waits for tool change, and continues excecution.
- Added About window.

V1.0c Minor

Bug fixes

- Corrected a problem when adjusting axis that caused all axis to move at the same time. Caused by grbl starting in incremental programming.

V1.0b Minor

Bug fixes

- Corrected a bug in the adjusting script.

V1.0a Minor

Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug reading some file formats that avoided the dials from updating.
