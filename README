Gcode sender, monitor and homing tool for GRBL for Windows and Linux systems.

Enhanced by Zapmaker. Kosme did a great deal of excellent foundation work on this 
project - my hat is off to him. Now we take this code to the next level.

The current code was tested with real milling projects using the Shapeoko and works
pretty well, it gets the job done. There are a number of enhancements I would like 
to add. See file TODO for this list.

Before you can do anything: 
1. Download Qt Creator (http://qt-project.org/downloads)
2. Open the project file ending with .pro
3. Build the executable (Windows and Linux)

V2.1x1

NOTE: Changes were only focused on Arduino GRBL capabilities with the Shapeoko, so 
things like Tool Change were not tested.

Enhancements
- Improved handling of response code - this is the most significant change as it 
ensures reliable send/response handling when sending a file to the Grbl processor.
- Manual command now allows hitting return and command is sent. No need to press Go.
- Default job step size changed from 0.01 to 1 mm
- Compiles and runs under Linux now (tested with Debian and latest Qt)
- Works with old 168 Arduino processor (except that old code is buggy and not recommended)
- Disabled "go to home at end of job". The arduino code doesn't handle it correctly 
and mills straight back into and through your work. Checkbox in settings has no effect.

Bug fixes
- Fixed crash when options file is not present the first time run
- Fixed crash when trying to get GRBL settings from device
- Settings work with 168 (8 settings) and 328 processors (10 settings)
- Fixed Stop to call proper routine stopsig - now Stop button works correctly

v2.1a

Bug fixes

- Corrected an issue that caused the program to crash if the g-code had blank lines.

V2.1 

New Features

- Gcode that is valid but is not recognized by GRBL gets filtered and it is not sent.

Bug fixes

- Corrected an issue that prevented manually sent Gcode for being displayed correctly.
- Corrected an issue with the images not displaying.

V2.0 Major release

- Improved the port handling reducing opening and closing frecuency.
- Added the ability to type and send commands directly. 
- Support for tool change instructions. If enabled it pauses execution, raises the spindle, goes to a fixed location for toolchange, waits for tool change, and continues excecution.
- Added About window.

V1.0c Minor

Bug fixes

- Corrected a problem when adjusting axis that caused all axis to move at the same time. Caused by grbl starting in incremental programming.

V1.0b Minor

Bug fixes

- Corrected a bug in the adjusting script.

V1.0a Minor

Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug reading some file formats that avoided the dials from updating.
